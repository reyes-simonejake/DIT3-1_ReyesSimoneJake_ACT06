# Which API did you choose and why?

I selected the News API because it allows applications to work with constantly changing content, which makes development more dynamic compared to static or mock data. It provided an opportunity to build features that depend on live information, such as updating lists and handling new content automatically. Using this API helped me better understand how real-time data integration works in an actual application environment.

# What challenges did you face when handling errors or slow connections?

A major challenge was ensuring that the application behaved correctly when network conditions were unstable. Slow responses sometimes caused UI delays, while unexpected API errors led to incomplete or missing data on the screen. Handling these situations required additional checks to prevent crashes and to make sure the app could recover gracefully without forcing the user to restart it.

# How would you improve your app’s UI or performance in future versions?

For future improvements, I would focus on making the interface more responsive during data operations. This includes adding visual feedback such as loaders or progress indicators, caching previously fetched data to reduce repeated API calls, and refining UI transitions to make the app feel smoother and more reliable overall.
